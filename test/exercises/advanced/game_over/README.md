# Exercise: Game Over

## Background:

In this exercise you will add a game over state to the game. After PacMan has lost all
of his lives the game will be over. PacMan should not respawn and the ghosts should
stop.

The GameState class has the number of lives and they are already drawn on screen so
that information can be used to indicate the game over state itself.

If the game is over, the text "Game Over" should be drawn over the game board. You do
not need to implement a new game, for this exercise restarting the application is
enough.
