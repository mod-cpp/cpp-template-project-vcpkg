# Exercise: Victory Screen

## Background:

As a continuation of the Game Over and New Level exercises. If PacMan beats 3 levels,
the game has been beaten and a victory screen should be shown.

A count of how many levels have been beaten needs to be stored and this should be
checked when transitioning between levels.

This should function similarly to the Game Over state but used to indicate that the
player won the game.
