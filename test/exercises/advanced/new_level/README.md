# Exercise: New Level

## Background:

In this exercise you will need to reset the game board but keep score and lives the
same. This should happen when PacMan eats the last pellet or super pellet.

The ghosts and pacman should go back to their original position and all of the pellets
should respawn. This can go on forever, but you can look at the next exercise for more
information.
