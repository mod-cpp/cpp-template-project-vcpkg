# Exercise: Generic Teleporting

## Background:

In the game and the exercise above, the teleports are linked to each other. These
systems are not very generic. Update the teleporting system so that two teleport doors
are linked with each other.

For example so you can enter a teleport from somewhere on the bottom row and exit from
somewhere on the right column.

You do not need to allow for many teleports like this, only 2 doors.
