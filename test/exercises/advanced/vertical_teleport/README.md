# Exercise: Vertical Teleport

## Background:

The teleporters are programmed to work only on the horizontal axis. Change the board
to add teleporters at the top and bottom row. This also requires a code change when
teleporting happens. These new teleporters only need to function like the existing
teleporters and you do not need to add more than one on each row.
